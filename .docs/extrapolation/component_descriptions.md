# Blitzkrieg: Component Descriptions

## Overview
Blitzkrieg is composed of several key components that work together to automate the software development process. Each component plays a specific role, contributing to the system's overall functionality and efficiency.

## Components

### 1. Project Initialization Module
- **Function:** Automates the creation of new projects, setting up GitHub repositories, and initializing project environments.
- **Key Features:**
  - Repository setup on GitHub.
  - Environment configuration including virtual environments and dependency management.
- **Interactions:** Works with cli using the following commands:
    - ```blitz init``` - sets up initial config for a meta database (in the future, this will be refactored into a project-group database system to have multiple repos connect to the same or various project-group databases.) This also sets up dockerized instances of Postgres and PGAdmin on the same docker network, adds the Postgre server to PgAdmin's config and provides connection details and instructions on how to connect to the db (this needs to be abstracted as well)
    - ```blitz project {project_name}```: this creates a new project in the databse, creates the repo on your local and on Github, creates all the directories and files for the initial setup, and more. Use it with the ```--db={db_name}``` flag or just ```--db``` to use the default database.
- **Future Ideas:**

### 2. Database Operations Module
- **Function:** Manages database-related tasks, automates CRUD operations, and service class generation.
- **Key Features:**
  - Automated generation of SQLAlchemy model classes.
  - CRUD operations and service layer automation.
- **Interactions:** Syncs with the .docs directory for document-database integration.

### 3. CI/CD Module
- **Function:** Handles continuous integration and deployment tasks.
- **Key Features:**
  - Integration with PyPi and Test PyPi for package distribution.
  - Automated build and deployment processes.
- **Interactions:** Receives inputs from the Project Initialization Module for deployment configurations.

### 4. Project Extrapolation and Ticketing Module
- **Function:** Interprets project requirements to generate development tasks and manage tickets.
- **Key Features:**
  - AI-driven analysis of project requirements.
  - Autonomous generation and management of development tasks and tickets.
- **Interactions:** Collaborates with the Document-Database Synchronization Module for updating tasks based on document changes.

### 5. Document-Database Synchronization Module
- **Function:** Synchronizes documents in the .docs directory with the database and GitHub issues.
- **Key Features:**
  - Real-time syncing of document edits with database updates.
  - Integration with GitHub issues for seamless project management.
- **Interactions:** Central to the system, interacts with most other modules for data consistency and project management.

### 6. User Interaction and Command Interface
- **Function:** Provides the primary interface for users to interact with Blitzkrieg, including CLI and document-based inputs.
- **Key Features:**
  - Flexible command interface through CLI.
  - Document-based input and modification capabilities for intuitive system interaction.
- **Interactions:** Interacts with all modules to execute user commands and relay system responses.

## Conclusion
The components of Blitzkrieg are designed to work seamlessly together, each contributing to a comprehensive and automated software development process. This modular approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
