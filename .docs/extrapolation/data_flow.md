## Data Flow in Blitzkrieg

### Initial Project Setup
1. **User Input:** The process begins with the user entering a project name and description via the CLI.
2. **Project Initialization Module:** This input is processed by the Project Initialization Module, which creates a new project in the system, sets up a corresponding GitHub repository, and initializes necessary environments and dependencies.

### Project Extrapolation and Planning
3. **AI-Driven Extrapolation:** The AI-Driven Project Extrapolation Module takes the project description and uses NLP and AI algorithms to extrapolate project requirements and necessary tasks.
4. **Ticket Generation:** Based on these extrapolations, the module generates development tickets and tasks, which are stored in the systemâ€™s database, to eventually actuate the vision of the extrapolations via the Sweep AI/AI Junior Developer integrations.

### Document-Database Synchronization
5. **.docs Directory Creation:** The Document-Database Synchronization Module creates initial documentation in the `.docs` directory, mirroring the generated tasks and tickets.
6. **Continuous Sync:** As the project evolves, any changes made to the documents in the `.docs` directory are synchronized with the project database. Similarly, updates in the database (like task completions or updates) are reflected in the `.docs` files. Any manual changes are autonomously reviewed by the system. Then the system uses function calling and GPT API to update the necessary dependent extrapolations, based on the changes the user made. This is a user-AI alignment correction structure to correct the trajectory of the project according to your own input, on the fly.

### Development Workflow
7. **Database Operations:** The Database Operations Module manages database-related tasks for the project, such as setting up tables and schemas based on project requirements.
8. **CI/CD Module Interaction:** Code changes pushed to the GitHub repository trigger the CI/CD Module, which handles testing, integration, and deployment to platforms like PyPi.

### GitHub Issue Management
9. **Issue Syncing:** GitHub issues, especially those marked with "Sweep:", are synchronized with the `.docs` directory. Updates on these issues are reflected in the corresponding documents, and vice versa.

### User Interaction and Overrides
10. **CLI Inputs:** The User Interface and Interaction Layer allows the user to input commands, request status updates, or make manual changes to the project plan or tasks.
11. **Feedback Loop:** User inputs or commands can alter the project's trajectory, such as changing priorities or adding new features, which are then processed back through the system, updating tasks, tickets, and documentation as necessary.

### Continuous Learning and Adaptation
12. **Post-Deployment Learning:** After deployment, the system collects data on performance and user feedback, which is used by the AI-Driven Project Extrapolation Module to refine and improve future project extrapolations and task generations.
