# Blitzkrieg: High-Level Overview

## Introduction
Blitzkrieg represents a paradigm shift in software development, offering a comprehensive, CLI-based tool that automates the software development lifecycle. As a digital Von Neumann machine for software, it autonomously manages and evolves software projects from inception to completion and beyond.

## Objectives
- To automate and streamline the entire software development process, including project setup, build management, and continuous integration/deployment.
- To incorporate advanced project extrapolation for autonomous task generation and ticket management.
- To facilitate rapid and intuitive project development, significantly reducing manual intervention.
- Integrate with an existing AI Junior Developer like Sweep AI to take the tickets generated, and complete them - closing the end-to-end software creation and maintenance automation loop, making the system approach full autonomy.

## Design Principles
Blitzkrieg is grounded in innovative principles:
1. **Autonomous Operation:** Designed for minimal human intervention, it autonomously makes decisions, adapts using algorithms, and learns from each project.
2. **Efficiency and Rapid Development:** Aims to reduce setup times, automate repetitive tasks, and accelerate the development process.
3. **Scalability and Adaptability:** Handles various project sizes and complexities, adaptable to different development needs.
4. **Intuitive Document-Database Synchronization:** Utilizes a `.docs` directory where documents are synced with the database and GitHub issues. This unique approach allows users to intuitively interact with the system, providing inputs or modifications through these documents, which the system then uses to update the database and project tasks.
5. **Multiple Interaction Modes:** Offers flexibility in interaction - through CLI commands, document-based input, or direct chat interfaces, catering to various user preferences.
6. **Innovative and Evolving:** Incorporates cutting-edge technologies, continuously evolving to stay at the forefront of software development automation.

## Scope
Blitzkrieg covers:
- Project setup, including GitHub repository configuration.
- Environment and dependency management.
- Database operations with CRUD and service class automation.
- CI/CD processes, with PyPi and Test PyPi deployments.
- Autonomous project extrapolation and task/ticket generation.
- Document-based interaction for intuitive project updates and AI collaboration.
- Automated resolution of GitHub issues and PR creation.

Basically, you give it a project name, and whatever else you want for input and you let it run wild. Just merge the PRs that come your way, and read and modify the project extrapolation documents to align the system with your desires.

## Conclusion
Blitzkrieg is a step into the future of software development, where automation, efficiency, and intuitive interfaces converge to streamline and enhance the development process. It allows developers to focus on creative and complex tasks, with foundational and operational aspects efficiently managed by the system.
