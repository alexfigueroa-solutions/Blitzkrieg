## Key Architectural Components

### 1. Central Control Unit
- **Function:** Acts as the brain of Blitzkrieg, coordinating between different modules, managing task queues, and ensuring efficient workflow management.
- **Interactions:** Communicates with all modules, sending and receiving information to maintain seamless operations.

### 2. Project Initialization and Management Module
- **Function:** Handles the creation and initial setup of new software projects, including repository creation and environment setup.
- **Interactions:** Provides necessary project details to other modules for subsequent tasks like database setup and CI/CD pipeline configuration.

### 3. AI-Driven Project Extrapolation Module
- **Function:** Utilizes AI algorithms to interpret project requirements and generate development tasks and tickets.
- **Interactions:** Collaborates with the Document-Database Synchronization Module to update project plans and tasks based on document modifications.

### 4. Document-Database Synchronization Module
- **Function:** Maintains real-time synchronization between project documents in the `.docs` directory and the project database, as well as GitHub issues.
- **Interactions:** Constantly interacts with the database and GitHub API, updating information based on changes in project documentation.

### 5. Database Operations Module
- **Function:** Manages all database-related operations, including CRUD operations and automatic generation of database schemas.
- **Interactions:** Works in tandem with the Project Extrapolation Module to align database structures with project requirements.

### 6. Continuous Integration and Deployment Module
- **Function:** Automates the processes of code integration, testing, and deployment to various platforms like PyPi.
- **Interactions:** Receives build and deployment configurations from the Project Management Module, executing deployments upon successful integration.

### 7. User Interface and Interaction Layer
- **Function:** Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with Blitzkrieg, offering commands for manual overrides, status checks, and custom inputs.
- **Interactions:** Interfaces with all modules, translating user commands into system actions and relaying information back to the user.

## Data Flow
