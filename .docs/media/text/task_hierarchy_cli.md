Writing comprehensive documentation for a feature as sophisticated as real-time status updates within a CLI task hierarchy involves detailed explanation of the feature, its usage, installation instructions, and clear examples. Here's a fleshed-out example of how you might write the documentation:

# Real-Time Task Management Feature Documentation

## Introduction

The real-time task management feature of the Blitzkrieg CLI provides users with a robust interface for managing database and DevOps tasks. With dynamic rendering capabilities, each task and subtask within the CLI updates its status in real time, ensuring that users have the latest information on the execution flow of their projects.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Task Organization:** Structure your workflows with main tasks and nested subtasks for better manageability.
- **Dynamic Status Updates:** Task statuses are updated in real time to reflect current progress or issues.
- **Data Propagation:** Output from one task is automatically passed to the next, ensuring efficient data handling within the workflow.
- **Interactive Configuration:** Input project configuration details directly into the CLI, shaping the task execution according to user-defined parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installing the Blitzkrieg CLI, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip package manager (typically included with Python)

### Installation

To install the Blitzkrieg CLI with the real-time task management feature, open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install blitzkrieg-cli
```

Replace `blitzkrieg-cli` with the actual package name if different.

## Usage Guide

### Starting a New Project

1. Open the terminal.
2. Run the Blitzkrieg CLI with the command:
    ```bash
    blitzkrieg
    ```
3. Choose `Start a new project` from the main menu.
4. Provide the requested project configuration details as prompted.

### Defining Steps and Tasks

Define your tasks using the `Step` and `TextComponent` classes provided by the Blitzkrieg CLI. Here is a sample snippet to define a workflow:

```python
from blitzkrieg import Step, TextComponent

def get_project_config_from_inquirer():
    # Your code to get the project configuration
    pass

# Define your steps and substeps
steps = [
    Step("Step 1: Create New Project", substeps=[
        TextComponent("User provides project config details")
    ], task=get_project_config_from_inquirer)
    # Additional steps can be added here
]
```

### Executing Tasks

Execute the defined steps by iterating over them and calling the `execute` method:

```python
for step in steps:
    step.execute()
```

The CLI will handle the rendering and status updates in real time as each step and substep is processed.

## Advanced Features

- **Task Dependencies:** Ensure tasks that rely on the output of previous tasks handle their dependencies correctly.
- **Error Handling:** Built-in error handling provides clear feedback in case of task failures, allowing for quick troubleshooting.

## Examples

Below is an example of initializing a new project with the Blitzkrieg CLI:

```python
# Example of initializing a new project
steps = [
    Step("Initialize Project", substeps=[
        TextComponent("Gathering project information")
    ], task=get_project_info)
]

# Executing the workflow
for step in steps:
    step.execute()
```
